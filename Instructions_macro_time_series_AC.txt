//Using Fiji to analyze Time-Series Micro-plaque Assays//

In the Macros section from Fiji, drag and drop "Macro_Time_Series.ijm" and a file with time-lapse images in format .tiff inside of this directory.
Note: the first nine images require to have 01, 02, 03 and so on in each label, instead of 1, 2, 3. Otherwise, Fiji would not organize the stack correctly.

	/Create a stack from sequence images
File
Import
Image sequence
	Browse in your current directory to select the file with time-lapses
	Sequence options: 
		Only check the box "Use virtual stack" This plugin opens images as a virtual stack in one single file 
	>>OK 

	/Save virtual stack
File
Save as 
	Tiff...
	Choose the same file and directory and name it as 0.0_Name.tiff 
		Note: this step will take some time
	Close Log window
	
	/Run the Macro with the virtual stack
Pluggins
Macro
Run
	Select "Macro_Time_Series.ijm"
	Choose the virtual stack directory 
	<<OK
	Enter experiment name: 
		Experiment: Specify treament of the plate you want to analyze
		Plate: select plate number from the image, E.g. 2 (top_right) 
		>>OK		
	Action required: Draw box by dragging the yellow guide to crop the selected plate 
		>>OK
	Rotate
		Angle: Choose an angle to straighten the plate in the image (E.g. 90.3 degrees for horizontal view)
		Select "Preview" check-box to see the angle changes
		Grid lines: This function is only useful to see the alignement of the Micro-colonies (E.g. 24)		
			Having a straight aligment is important for the final density analysis
		Type 0 in "Grid lines" once you finish the aligment
		Select "Enlarge Image" check-box		
		>>OK
	Process Stack? 
		>>YES
	Define grid
		xmult: Meaning how width do you need the grid to match with all Micro-colonies, E.g. 106.600
		ymult: Meaning how high do you need the grid, E.g. 103.400
		offsetx: Meaning how wide do you need the grid, E.g. 11.000
		offsety: Meaning how wide do you need the grid, E.g. -904.000
		Click OK each time you move the grid around the Micro-colonies to see changes
			Note: Play around with the grid numbers until obtaining a satisfactorily aligned grid that covers all your Micro-colonies
		Check the "Okay?" box
	>>OK

The Macro will process each Micro-colony and will close all windows automatically.
 
Inside the current working directory, it will show three files, the last image from the stack, the image with a grid showing the measured regions of interest, and a .csv with the taken densities.
